My second Data Analysis project

As I am working on a restaurant data I focused on the most orders that made maximum revenues and the correlation between the data columns to reach a maximum benefit form this data. 

Python libraries used in this project:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
y_data_profiling

MY Steps and Questions:
DATA CLEANING STEP:
1. Handling missing values ('if there!')
2. Handling the incorrect data types ('if there !)
3. Detect outliers ('if there')
DATA WRANGLING STEP:
1. Make the 'order_id' as the Index of the 'df'
ANALYSIS STEP:
1. showing the statistical description for the data
2. What is the distribution of quantities sold for different items?
3. Which are the top 5 most frequently ordered items?
4. Visualise the numeric columns
5. What are the most common choice descriptions for specific items?
6. What is the total revenue generated from item sales?
7. What is the average quantity of items sold per order?
8. What are the most popular items based on total quantity sold?
9. Sort item names by their quantities ascendingly
10. Visualize the correlation 
11. Which item names have the highest revenue ?
USE THE "y_data_profiling lib" to automate the EDA steps anda generate a small report about the data
